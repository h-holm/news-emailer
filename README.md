# news-emailer

A script using [Mutt](http://www.mutt.org) to send scraped news files as email attachments.

See [mutt-setup gist](https://gist.github.com/h-holm/b023df59207926511f4399d6342d87c0) for guidance on setting up the `mutt` command-line utility.

Run the [send_news_over_email.sh](./send_news_over_email.sh) script with the `--help` flag for details on how to use the script:

```shell
$ ./send_news_over_email.sh --help
```
